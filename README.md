## How to Use

<div align="center">

![The recipe for the Reaper](https://cdn.jamalam.tech/mod-assets/reaping-recipe.png)

</div>

1. Craft a Reaper; Iron, Gold, Diamond, and Netherite variants are available.
2. Right-click on an animal (or human...) to harvest it.
3. The animal turns into a child and drops meat!
4. Sometimes, the animal will die during the reaping process - upgrade your reaper to avoid this,
   and make sure it doesn't have the Curse of Bluntness!

## How to Configure

Reaping can be configured via an in-game configuration screen which can be accessed in the mods
screen.

## I think I found a bug!
