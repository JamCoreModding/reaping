## Harvest your animals in the most cursed way possible.

By using the Reaper you can harvest food from animals as if you had killed them, but without the guilt of killing them - the reaper tool simply cuts off most of the animal, making them a child again - **_science_**!

- Obtain 4 types of reaper, the Iron Reaper, the Gold Reaper, the Diamond Reaper, and the Netherite Reaper. The sharpness and cooldown system means each has its own benefits and drawbacks!
- Reap animals to turn them into babies and drop meat; reap babies to kill them and drop bones!
- Reap players or villagers to obtain s̶u̴s̷p̵i̷c̷i̵o̴u̶s̶ ̸m̸e̷a̵t̸...
- Put a reaper in a dispenser to automate your crimes!
- Fight a new kind of pillager, who carries a reaper!
